## INTRODUCTION
**Atliq Grands**, a company with multiple five-star hotels across India and two decades of experience in the hospitality industry, is facing a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category due to competitive pressures and ineffective management decisions. In response, the managing director has recognized the need to incorporate "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain their competitive edge. However, lacking an in-house data analytics team, the company's revenue management team has opted to engage a third-party service provider to analyze their historical data and provide the necessary insights.

## Objective ðŸŽ¯
- Provide **Revenue Team Insights** in Hospitality Sector.
- You are a Data Analyst tasked with analyzing sample data and creating a **mock-up dashboard**
- Develop metrics based on the **metric list**.
- Design a dashboard based on stakeholder-provided mock-up.
- Generate additional insights beyond the provided metric list/mock-up dashboard.

  ## Create Metrics
 - Total Bookings
- Revenue
- Average Rating
- Total Capacity
- Total Successful bookings
- Occupancy %
- Total Cancelled Bookings
- Cancellation Rate

  ## Key Measures and DAX Formulas
**TO create the needed metrics for the dashboard i created 26 measures in Power Bi using DAX(data analytics expression)**
    
 - Revenue = SUM(fact_bookings[revenue_realized])
   
- Total Bookings = COUNT(fact_bookings[booking_id])
  
- Total Capacity = SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[capacity])

- Total Succesful Bookings = SUM(fact_aggregated_bookings[successful_bookings])
  
- Occupancy % = DIVIDE([Total Succesful Bookings],[Total Capacity],0)

- Average Rating = AVERAGE(fact_bookings[ratings_given])

- No of days = DATEDIFF(MIN(dim_date[date]),MAX(dim_date[date]),DAY) +1

- Total cancelled bookings = CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="Cancelled")

- Cancellation % = DIVIDE([Total cancelled bookings],[Total Bookings])

- Total Checked Out = CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="Checked Out")

- Total no show bookings = CALCULATE([Total Bookings],fact_bookings[booking_status]="No Show")

- No Show rate % = DIVIDE([Total no show bookings],[Total Bookings])
  
- Booking % by Platform = DIVIDE([Total Bookings],CALCULATE([Total Bookings], ALL(fact_bookings[booking_platform])))*100"
  
- Booking % by Room class = DIVIDE([Total Bookings],CALCULATE([Total Bookings], ALL(dim_rooms[room_class])))*100"

- ADR = DIVIDE( [Revenue], [Total Bookings],0)

- Realisation % = 1- ([Cancellation %]+[No Show rate %])

- RevPAR = DIVIDE([Revenue],[Total Capacity])

- DBRN = DIVIDE([Total Bookings], [No of days])

- DSRN = DIVIDE([Total Capacity], [No of days])

- DURN = DIVIDE([Total Checked Out],[No of days])

- Revenue WoW change % = 
   Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
  var revcw = CALCULATE([Revenue],dim_date[wn]= selv)
  var revpw =  CALCULATE([Revenue],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))return DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1
  
- Occupancy WoW change % = Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
var revcw = CALCULATE([Occupancy %],dim_date[wn]= selv)
var revpw =  CALCULATE([Occupancy %],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))return DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1"

- ADR WoW change % = 
Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
var revcw = CALCULATE([ADR],dim_date[wn]= selv)
var revpw =  CALCULATE([ADR],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))return DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1"

- Revpar WoW change % = Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
   var revcw = CALCULATE([RevPAR],dim_date[wn]= selv)
  var revpw =  CALCULATE([RevPAR],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))return DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1"

- Realisation WoW change % = Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
  var revcw = CALCULATE([Realisation %],dim_date[wn]= selv)
   var revpw =  CALCULATE([Realisation %],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1))return DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1"


- DSRN WoW change % = Var selv = IF(HASONEFILTER(dim_date[wn]),SELECTEDVALUE(dim_date[wn]),MAX(dim_date[wn]))
   var revcw = CALCULATE([DSRN],dim_date[wn]= selv)
   var revpw =  CALCULATE([DSRN],FILTER(ALL(dim_date),dim_date[wn]= selv-1)) return DIVIDE(revcw,revpw,0)-1"

  ## ## Conclusion ðŸ’¡
- Suggested, ways to **raise revenue by 29%** and enhance occupancy rates. Take **advantage of late bookings and additional days of stay to increase revenue**
- Occupancy Percentage is maximum on **Weekends**
- Maximum bookings are done through **others and makeyourtrip** platform
- Average rating is between **3.65 and 3.6**
- **Delhi** is showing high average rating
- **Mumbai and Hyderabad** shows high **fall in occupancy** during June
